To run the solution follow the steps:

1) open phpmyadmin in browser and create a database "vtc".
     - (If you have already created then delete all the tables in vtc database by selecting "drop option for every table"
2) Place the Solution3 folder in www folder of wamp (htdocs for xampp) 
3) In browser URL type - localhost/Solution3/create_table.php (This will create the required tables)
4) Then open phpmyadmin again in vtc database click on items table insert the data
	- PID: 1
	- cart: 0
	- Price :(whatever you want)
(Like this add as many data bt should be more than 6 as you have 6 items to buy in order now - initially cart must be 0 and PID must start from 1 upto n)

5) Now everyhting is set and you can run the solution by typing in URL localhost/Solution3/index.php
